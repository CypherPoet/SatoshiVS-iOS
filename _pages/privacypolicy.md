# Satoshi VS Privacy Notice

Satoshi VS (the "App") was built by Brian Sipple, and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information belonging to anyone who decided to use the App.


## Privacy Practices

Satoshi VS is intended to be used on an anonymous basis. I therefore do not collect, use, maintain or share any personal information about you when you use the App, and I do not use any tracking technology to track your use of the App. I also do not allow third parties to collect personal information about you when you use the App, or to use tracking technology to track your use of the App.


## Crash Logs

If you opt in to sending crash logs, both Apple and I will receive a copy.

When the App sends a crash log, it sends only the text of the crash log. No additional information, such as an email address, is sent.

Crash logs are stored privately and are kept confidential. They are solely used for the purpose of fixing crashing bugs.


## Links to Other Sites

This App may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.


## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.


## Questions or Comments

If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at brsipple572@gmail.com.
